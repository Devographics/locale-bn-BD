            <span class="first-letter">T</span>he JavaScript tide might be turning. 

            After years of relative stability, many are now beginning to question the status quo. New front-end frameworks like Solid and Qwik are whispering that React might not have all the answers after all. And on the server, Astro, Remix and Next.js (among others) are making us reconsider how much JavaScript code we really need to ship to the client. 

            This all suggests that today's best practices might soon have an expiration date attached. Which makes it all the more awesome that we got a massive **39,472** responses to this year's survey. We'll need all the data we can get if we want to figure out where JavaScript is going!
            
            Data isn't worth much without the tools to analyze it though, and that's why we've developed two new ways to interact with our dataset: the **Data Explorer** lets you cross-reference two variables and highlight any outlying results; while **Chart Filters** let you filter specific charts by salary, country, gender, and many other demographic variables. 

            We've also replaced our catch-all "back-end" category with a more specific Rendering Frameworks page. And added a very exciting new "Video Creators" list to the Resources section. 

            Oh and I almost forgot! Features and Libraries questions also now have a **Comments** icon that lets you see what people actually think of the items mentioned in the survey!

            With all this out of the way, let's discover what JavaScript has been up to in 2022!

          ## Support the Survey With the State of JavaScript T-Shirt

          Between the bad video quality, the bulky cassettes, and having to rewind, there's not much to miss about the VHS era. But one thing we *do* miss are the amazing 90s visuals that used to adorn blank VHS tapes. 

          But now, thanks to the talented Christopher Kirk-Nielsen you can enjoy all this retro radness while also celebrating your love for JavaScript at the same time!

          This year, **39,471** respondents took part in the survey. And in order
          to help highlight different voices and surface deeper insights, we made a special
          effort to provide new ways to break our data down.

          JavaScript may move fast, but it seems like JavaScript developers move even faster, as many relatively new features already show high adoption levels. 

    - key: sections.technologies.description
      t: |
          This year's results point to a high degree of fragmentation in the JavaScript world. But while this can sometimes cause headaches, all that competition does make for a very dynamic ecosystem. 

    - key: sections.tools_others.description
      t: |
          Picking a technology can often come down to a series of tough choices between 
          competing priorities, and this year we tried to capture this process using a new bracket-style question format. 

    - key: sections.environments.description
      t: |
          Accessibility has long been an after-thought when it comes to web development, but many developers
          are now realizing that it should in fact be the foundation on which everything else rests. 

    - key: sections.resources.description
      t: |
          Highlighting blogs, podcasts, and sites was a good start, but this year we decided to go one step further
          and actually feature the people who make up the JavaScript community!

          Whether it's pain points that hold you back today, or missing features that you hope to use

    - key: conclusion.js2022
      t: |

            <span class="first-line">JavaScript is in a tremendously better state today compared to 2016.</span>
            
            Back when the first State of JS survey took place, only 21% of you used TypeScript compared to 69% today. Whereas we used to joke about a new front end framework releasing every day, **React** and **Vue** have now been dominant for 6 years running. And the percentage of people reporting that "JS is moving too fast" is down from 59% to 38%.

            This is not to say that the language has stood still. The **Optional Chaining** and **Nullish Coalescing** APIs have rocketed up to be the most used new APIs in our survey, despite only being 2 years old. And more good things are on the way from TC39: you reported that date management is a top missing feature, and the Temporal API recently reached [Stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal).

            The tooling ecosystem is also seeing its own rapid evolution, and it's fair to say that 2021 has been the year of **Vite**. Vite not only debuted at 98% retention, but usage is already at 30% in its first year on our survey, even eclipsing esbuild. Vite isn't alone in trying to improve the state of JavaScript build tools - 8 of the 12 tools we track today are less than two years old! And while **pnpm**, **Turborepo**, and **Nx** took the top spots in our first year tracking monorepo tooling, only 25% report being happy with the state of that category, showing that a lot of work remains to be done. 
            
            Also notable: many new entrants like **Deno**, **Rome**, **Astro**, **Remix**, and more are now supported by venture-backed companies, perhaps charting a viable alternative to the fragile open-source funding environment.

            As the [Third Age of JavaScript](https://www.swyx.io/js-third-age/) enters its third year, the opportunities for aspiring open sourcerors and entrepreneurs continue to unfold, and I'm excited to see what the next couple years bring!

            The 2021 State of JS survey ran from January 13 to February 2 **2022**, and collected 16,085 responses. The survey is run by me, [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/), with help from a team of open-source contributors and consultants. 

            This year's logo and t-shirt were designed by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).

            ### Survey Goals

            This survey, along with the [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com/) survey, was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices. 

            As such, these surveys are focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included. 

            They should also be taken as a **snapshot of a specific subset of developers**, and are not meant to speak for the entire ecosystem. 

            ### Survey Design

            The survey was designed in part based on last year's survey, with an open feedback period where the survey outline was discussed [on GitHub](https://github.com/StateOfJS/Monorepo/issues/56). 
            
            All survey questions were optional. 

            ### Survey Audience

            The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way. Respondents were primarily a mix of respondents from past surveys (alerted through a dedicated mailing list) and social media traffic. 

            Note that frameworks, libraries, etc. were free to encourage their audience to participate in the survey and some of them did take advantage of this via banners, tweets, etc. A detailed breakdown of traffic sources is included in the "Sources" chart. 

            ### Representativeness & Inclusivity

            While we believe it's important to give a voice to every community, the reality is that an open survey like this one will always struggle to properly represent everybody, especially when operating through systems that already carry their own inherent biases. 


            In order to counter-balance this, we are implementing three distinct strategies:


            - **Outreach**: we always try to reach out to different organizations (such as BIPOC- or LGBTQ-focused organizations, or online teaching platforms) to try and diversify our own audience. 
            
            - **Data Analysis**: through features like facets and variants, we're always trying to make it easier to surface the voices of any demographic segment, no matter how minoritized it might be in our data. 
            
            - **Barrier Lowering**: making the survey too long, inaccessible, slow to load, English-only, etc. can all contribute to imposing an "effort tax" that cuts off the parts of the community that can't afford to pay it. Fixing these issues can lower the barrier to entry and in the process make our audience more diverse. 

            ### Project Funding

            Funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:


            - **T-shirt sales**. 

            - **Chart Sponsorships**: members of the community can donate to the survey in exchange for having their name featured in the report.  

            - **Sponsored links**: the links to recommended resources at the bottom of each page are provided by our partner [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).
            
            - **Other Funding**: this year, the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) team set aside a small budget to help hire an [accessibility consultant](https://fossheim.io/) to work on the CSS and JS surveys.


            Despite these funding sources, the surveys remains mostly a self-funded project overall and any contribution or sponsorship would be greatly appreciated. I would especially like to work closely with more browser vendors, since they play such a central role in the web ecosystem.
